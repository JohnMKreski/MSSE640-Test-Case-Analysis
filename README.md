# MSSE640-Test-Case-Analysis

This repository contains weekly test case analysis reports for the **MSSE 640: Software Quality and Testing** course at Regis University.

## 📘 About
Each week, students are tasked with analyzing a specific **software testing methodology**. These analyses are documented in markdown format and are accompanied by simple Java programs that demonstrate the methodology in practice. The goal is to reinforce theoretical understanding through practical implementation.

## 🔍 Weekly Content
Each folder contains:
- A **Test Case Analysis** written in Markdown, describing the theory and use cases.
- A simple **Java implementation** to simulate the technique and test the program using each methodology.
- A **program guide** with setup and execution instructions.

## 🧪 Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured way to:
- Learn and apply different software testing strategies.
- Practice writing clean and testable code.
- Document and reflect on testing methodologies.
